# Caesar Cipher/ROT 13

The Caesar Cipher or Caesar Shift is a cipher which uses the alphabet in order to encode texts. It shifts a letter to a particular value.

`CAESAR` encoded with a shift of 8 is `KIMAIZ` so `ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ` becomes `IJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFGH`.

`ROT13` is a special case of Caesar Cipher which has a fixed shift of 13, this is a trivial cipher to bruteforce because there are only 25 shifts. So the code to encode plain text to ROT13 can be used to decode the cipher text.
