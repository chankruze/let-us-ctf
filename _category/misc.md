Many challenges in CTFs will be completely random and unprecedented, requiring simply logic, knowledge, and patience to be solved. There is no sure-fire way to prepare for these, but as you complete more CTFs you will be able to recognize and hopefully have more clues on how to solve them.

Misc challenges may require knowledges on multiple categories (ie. crypto, forensic, reversing) to solve one challenge. Everything you learned can be applied here.
