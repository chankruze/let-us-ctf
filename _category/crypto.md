## What is Cryptography ?

Cryptography is a method of protecting information and communications through the use of codes. The prefix "crypt-" means "hidden" or "vault" -- and the suffix "-graphy" stands for "writing."

The word “cryptography” technically means the art of writing codes. When it comes to digital forensics, it’s a method you can use to understand how data is constructed for your analysis.

## What is cryptography used for?

**Uses in every day software:**
- Securing web traffic (passwords, communication, etc.)
- Securing copyrighted software code
- Securing API keys etc.

**Malicious uses:**
- Hiding malicious communication
- Hiding malicious code
