Did you check this site ?

**Hint:** Use Experience from Check Again & Google "DMARC"

<!--walkthrough-->

### Using Given Hint

See walkthrough of "Check Again" for basic knowledge. When we search "DMARC" on google we get to know that DMARC is an email authentication protocol. But it's given that use experience from check again, so it's maybe not too deep into email auth.

### Tools Used

- `dnsrecon` (a python script used for DNS information gathering)

### Enumeration

Some times flag is hidden in DNS records of a domain either as a `TXT` or `SPF` records. The flag maybe encrypted or not. Let's first check the standard record of the target domain.

```bash
dnsrecon -d <target_domain> #here target is ctf.geekofia.in
```

So, after executing above comamnd, result is:

```terminal
user@ctf-box:~$ dnsrecon -d ctf.geekofia.in
[*] Performing General Enumeration of Domain: ctf.geekofia.in
[-] All nameservers failed to answer the DNSSEC query for ctf.geekofia.in
[-] Could not Resolve NS Records for ctf.geekofia.in
[-] Could not Resolve MX Records for ctf.geekofia.in
[*]      A ctf.geekofia.in 104.28.23.176
[*]      A ctf.geekofia.in 104.28.22.176
[*]      AAAA ctf.geekofia.in 2606:4700:3035::681c:16b0
[*]      AAAA ctf.geekofia.in 2606:4700:3036::681c:17b0
[*]      TXT ctf.geekofia.in LUC{XXX_XXXXX_
[*] Enumerating SRV Records
[+] 0 Records Found
```

So here we found a `TXT` record having partial flag but there is no `SPF` records. Maybe there are some records other then `TXT` and `SPF` which contains other part of the flag. What if there is also some record type for `DMARC` ? Let's dive in !

On googling we found a website [MXToolbox](https://mxtoolbox.com/dmarc.aspx{:target="_blank"} to check for DMARC record. But unfortunately it's unable to find any record.

Let's gather some more info about DMARC record. On googling "DMARC record in DNS" and looking through the search results and images, from [here](https://www.dmarcanalyzer.com/how-to-create-a-dmarc-record/){:target="_blank"} we learn that it is by default saved as `_dmarc.<domain_name>`.

What we can try now is modifying our target domain to `_dmarc.ctf.geekofia.in` and see if we get any clue. Let's use `dnsrecon` tool again (should use help to know all the usage of it).

```terminal
user@ctf-box:~$ dnsrecon -d _dmarc.ctf.geekofia.in
[*] Performing General Enumeration of Domain: _dmarc.ctf.geekofia.in
[-] All nameservers failed to answer the DNSSEC query for _dmarc.ctf.geekofia.in
[-] Could not Resolve NS Records for _dmarc.ctf.geekofia.in
[-] Could not Resolve MX Records for _dmarc.ctf.geekofia.in
[*]      TXT _dmarc.ctf.geekofia.in XX_XXX}
[*] Enumerating SRV Records
[+] 0 Records Found
```

Cool! we found the last piece. Joining both parts we get the flag.

### Lesson

Actually from one of my experiments on DNS records i came to know that there can be record of any name in DNS. So i also have the flag for "Check Again" stored under `_flag`, do enumerate it ! So improve your undrstanding & googling skill to find out the place !
