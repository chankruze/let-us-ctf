Did you check `geekofia.in` ?

**Hint:** Dante Nero Sparda are the true demons. They will help you find the flag !

<!--walkthrough-->

### Using Given Hint

Read the hint once again carefully noticing the caps ! It was given "Dante Nero Sparda are the true demons." Only keeping capital characters, we get clear hint `DNS`. Now we can use google to search "tools to analyse DNS". We get the first link of [InfoSec](https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/dns-analysis-and-tools/).

### Tools Used

- `dnsrecon` (a python script used for DNS information gathering)

### Enumeration

Some times flag is hidden in DNS records of a domain either as a `TXT` or `SPF` records. The flag maybe encrypted or not. Let's first check the standard record of the target domain.

```bash
dnsrecon -d <target_domain> #here target is geekofia.in
```

So, after executing above comamnd, result is:

```terminal
user@ctf-box:~$ dnsrecon -d geekofia.in

[-] All nameservers failed to answer the DNSSEC query for geekofia.in
[*]      SOA bart.ns.cloudflare.com 173.245.59.71

[*]      AAAA geekofia.in 2606:4700:8dec:d700:a8df:4d0c:681c:16b0
[*]      SPF v=spf1 LUC{XXXX_XXXXX_XX_XXXX_XXXX_XX_XXX_XXX_XXXXXXX}
[*] Enumerating SRV Records
[+] 0 Records Found
```

So here we found no `TXT` records but there is one `SPF` record which contains the flag in plain text. Maybe some other cases there'll flag encrypted.

### Lesson

Whenever there is a target domain and nothing else under OSINT category, do a `dnsrecon` for all the records !
